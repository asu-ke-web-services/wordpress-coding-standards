==========================

php coding standards for phpcs v0.2.3.

The newer coding standards are actually hosted by [wordpress on github](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards), but they require a newer version of phpcs which isn't really stable yet. This is why we're maintaining this repository for currently stable versions of phpcs.

The origins of this code are unknown, someone found them on the internet somewhere and we've been using them ever since.
